The primary purpose of this project is to identify and evaluate the most effective machine learning model for classifying student performance based on the provided dataset. By leveraging detailed information on demographics, study habits, parental involvement, extracurricular activities, and academic performance, the project aims to select and assess various classification algorithms to determine which model best predicts students' grades. This analysis will help in understanding how different factors influence academic outcomes and in selecting a model that delivers accurate and actionable predictions for educational research and intervention strategies.
